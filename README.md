## Abstract
Extreme weather events, such as heat waves and cold snaps, pose significant risks to the power grid. The United States (U.S.) Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order No. 896 mandates regional coordination standards that account for extreme thermal events. However, the lack of a universal definition for extreme thermal events may lead to inconsistent compliance efforts among neighboring entities, undermining reliability of the transmission system. This study evaluates the impact of different definitions of heat waves and cold snaps on constructing extreme event libraries for reliability studies. We used 12 event definitions and multiple temperature spatial aggregation approaches to construct historical (1980-2024) regional extreme thermal event libraries across North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) subregions in the conterminous U.S. We examined the sensitivity of event characteristics (e.g., duration, frequency, intensity, and spatial coverage) to different definitions. While some definitions produced similar libraries and top event rankings, definitions based on moving-window-averaged temperatures yielded markedly different characteristics. Spatial aggregation methods had minimal impact on heat wave or cold snap intensity, frequency and duration but significantly influenced spatial coverage. The top events identified by different aggregation methods were largely consistent, exhibiting only minor variations in rankings, which were slightly more influenced by aggregation methods than by event definitions.. These findings offer critical insights for characterizing and selecting extreme thermal events and for supporting local and cross-regional coordination as required by reliability standards. Beyond its application in the power sector, this library supports diverse domains, such as climate research, resilient infrastructure design, agricultural risk management, public health, and disaster preparedness.
